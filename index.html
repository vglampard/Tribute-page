<h1 id="title"> María Felix - Trivia and Curios </h1>

 <ul id="tribute-info">
    <li> Actress and singer, lived 1914-2002 - and died on her birthday. </li>
    <li> Known as La Doña, or María Bonita. The former name from one of her most famous roles as the heroine in Doña Bárbara, and the latter from the song her second husband, renowned Mexican composer Agustín Lara, wrote for her birthday. </li>
    <li> A femme fatale icon of Mexican cinema, Félix refused all her life  to work in American cinema, in spite of receiving numerous offers. </li>
    <li> Mexican muralist Diego Rivera fell in love with her and painted her portrait - she called it "very bad" and when he requested it for a show in Paris, had it painted over by a bricklayer and sold it herself - as she says, proudly, "very badly." </li>   
</ul>
